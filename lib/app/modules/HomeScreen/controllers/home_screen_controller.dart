     "Today was an exciting day for the entire faculty group and students at The International School of Bombay. We spent a memorable day with exceptional Kriti Sanon and beloved Varun Dhawan, who graciously gave us the pleasure of welcoming them for the movie promotion of  Bhediya. We danced, we sang, we laughed, and enjoyed ourselves with utter excitement."
      " We canâ€™t even explain the enthusiasm and zeal that surrounded our entire school during the whole encounter with Kriti Sanon and Varun Dhawan.  Both of them were extremely sweet, and humble, and shared some beautiful moments with our students and teachers. It was indeed an honour to meet such graceful and talented people."
     " The movie releases on 25th November, and we must say all our students and faculty members are eagerly waiting to head to the theatre and enjoy this phenomenal movie filled with twists, turns, and laughter."
